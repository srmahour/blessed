He was born with skilled remote viewing and psychic abilities that steered his life.",
  "gene-2": "In August of 1990, Gene had an epiphany in which he suddenly realized the existence and massive influence of the Satanic Deep State cabal. Gene immediately began massive research to disprove this, however everything he found only made it more obvious. Gene then enlisted several of his martial arts students to disprove his account. Not only could they NOT disprove what he learned, they confirmed it through credible sources.",
  "gene-3": "In a Death Experience in August of 1992 (he died for 30 minutes) he met God and after taking a Holy Covenant God allowed him to return to be of service to humanity, the Earth and God’s creation.
